# Sampling Techniques for Machine Learning Models

This repository demonstrates various sampling techniques to address class imbalance in datasets and evaluates their impact on machine learning model performance. The implementations are provided in a Google Colab Notebook.
---

## ðŸ“‹ Objective

To analyze the impact of different sampling techniques on model performance and establish best practices for handling imbalanced datasets effectively.

---

## ðŸ›  Techniques Implemented

1. **Oversampling**: Increases the number of minority class samples to balance the dataset.
2. **Undersampling**: Reduces the number of majority class samples.
3. **Systematic Sampling**: Selects samples at regular intervals from the dataset.
4. **Stratified Sampling**: Ensures class proportions are maintained in the sampled data.
5. **Cluster Sampling**: Randomly selects clusters of data, using them as representative samples.
6. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Samples data with replacement to create new datasets.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

The following models were tested with each sampling technique:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Observations

- **Oversampling**: Improved performance on imbalanced datasets by enhancing minority class representation.
- **Stratified Sampling**:Ensured proportional representation of classes and performed well on unevenly distributed datasets.
- **Random Forest & Decision Tree**: Consistently achieved high accuracy across most sampling techniques.
- **Cluster Sampling**: Was effective when the clusters were meaningful and representative of the overall dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Notebook**: Contains all implementations and results for the sampling techniques and model evaluations.
- **Data**: Example datasets for testing the techniques.
- **Results**: Includes performance metrics and visualizations for each technique.
